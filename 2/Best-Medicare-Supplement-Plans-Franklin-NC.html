<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, might be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this year if you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after 65, you should half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal up to avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of if you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
