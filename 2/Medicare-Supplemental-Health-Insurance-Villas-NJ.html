While HMOs and PPOs are frequent forms of private medical health insurance plans, PFFSs are designed particularly for Medicare. These plans permit you to see any doctor or health professional who is eligible to receive payments for Medicare and who agrees to the plan's guidelines and policies.

<p>As a basic rule, people who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) previous age 65 need to confer with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether they need to enroll in Part B or not.

This can be true if you are lined underneath your partner's employer coverage. You have 8 months to enroll in Original Medicare with no late penalty.<p>
