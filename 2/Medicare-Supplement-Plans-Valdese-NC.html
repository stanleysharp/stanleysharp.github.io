How do they verify whether or not you could have or didn’t have a bunch health plan?<p>
<p>And Medicare will definitely not require you to maintain it when you join. Once your group health coverage ends, you get a particular enrollment interval that lasts eight months. Though you don’t need to enroll in Medicare at age 65 if you have coverage by way of a certified group health plan, doing so would possibly make sense if that plan isn’t heavily backed by your employer.<p>
<p>Because you should pay a premium for Part B coverage, you can turn it down. Medicare Part B helps pay for services from medical doctors and different health care suppliers, outpatient care, house health care, durable medical equipment, and some preventive services. The program helps with the cost of health care, nevertheless it does not cover all medical expenses or the cost of most lengthy-time period care.

Medicare is our nation's medical health insurance program for people age 65 or older.<p>
