In most states and most circumstances, you’ll have to undergo medical underwriting should you resolve to apply for a Medigap plan after that window ends.

<p>Instead, you’ll receive a bill for Medicare Part B for as long as you aren’t yet collecting Social Security. If you enroll in Medicare Part A, you’ll need to stop contributing to your HSA.<p>

When very small employers join along with other employers in situations like this, the plan will provide main coverage so long as a minimum of one of the employers has 20+ staff. But employers can also ask for exceptions to the first/secondary rule in that circumstance, so he’ll should check along with his group plan to see what their specific rules are.
