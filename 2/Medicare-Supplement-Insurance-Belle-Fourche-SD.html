Original Medicare includes Part A and Part B. Part A covers inpatient hospital companies, skilled nursing care facility expenses and hospice care.

Instead of merely responding to a gross sales pitch from an insurance agent or to an ad, check all the Medicare options in your area. Compare plans using the Medicare Options Compare device at Medicare.gov/mppf, taking a look at both premiums and total estimated prices for individuals like yourself.
