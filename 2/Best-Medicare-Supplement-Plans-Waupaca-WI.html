I am now 60 and my circumstances have modified where I could must work on an off-the-cuff foundation. For example if I work 40 hours/week for three months, and then nothing for the rest of the year, is my work averaged out over the yr, which might deliver me beneath the ten hours/week? Or would this break the 10 hours/week rule, and what are the consequences?
