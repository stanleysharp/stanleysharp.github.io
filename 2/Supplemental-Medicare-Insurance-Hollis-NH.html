<p>Third, people who reside in two totally different geographical areas of the nation at different times of the year (largely so-called snowbirds) find it troublesome to stay with the geographic restrictions of most public Part C plans.

In addition Medicare Advantage plans could cover benefits in a different way. For instance, plans that require greater out-of-pocket costs than Medicare Parts A or B for some benefits, such as skilled nursing facility care, may supply lower copayments for physician visits to steadiness their benefits package deal.<p>

In distinction to Medicare Advantage plans, traditional Medicare does not usually require prior authorization for services, and does not require step therapy for Part B medication.<p>
