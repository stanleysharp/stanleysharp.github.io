<p>People who aren’t yet amassing Social Security, or aren’t eligible for Social Security Retirement, aren’t automatically enrolled into Medicare. Some folks get Medicare Part A and Part B automatically and a few people need to join them.<p>
<p>You're coated by a bunch health plan by way of the employer or union based mostly on that work.
