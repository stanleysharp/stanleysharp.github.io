<p>If you are turning sixty five and have employer-based coverage via your personal job, you can delay signing up. Is the insurance via your work, or do you buy it individually/individually? If sure, then you need to consider signing up for Medicare or you would face Part B enrollment penalties, denied claims, or more. I will turn 65 on July 6, 2020 so I will begin Medicare on July 1, 2020.

Most people don't pay a monthly premium for Part A (sometimes called "premium-free Part A"). If you paid Medicare taxes for less than 30 quarters, the usual Part A premium is $458. If you paid Medicare taxes for quarters, the standard Part A premium is $252.<p>
