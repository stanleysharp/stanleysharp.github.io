<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent payments, might be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this yr should you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal up to keep away from tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because if you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
