If you or your partner paid Medicare taxes no less than 10 years while working, you typically don’t need to pay a Medicare Part A premium. Because you and your partner enroll in Medicare individually, you may make completely different choices in the way you receive your Medicare benefits. As a results of these choices, you may have differences in your Medicare benefits. There are 4 “components” to the Medicare insurance program, each one offering a sure set of Medicare benefits.<p>

Having Part A will disqualify any HSA contributions he makes for that portion of the year, which may result in penalties. It may in some way make sense to maintain Medicare Part B even if your plan switches back and forth between main coverage, simply to avoid uncertainty. That stated, you should qualify for Special Enrollment into Part B when you do resolve to delay enrollment.<p>
