<p>Remember that if you don't enroll in Medicare Part B throughout your Special Enrollment Period, you’ll have to attend till the following General Enrollment Period, which happens from January 1 to March 31 each year. You might then have to pay a late-enrollment penalty for Medicare Part B because you could have had Part B and did not enroll. If you owe a late-enrollment penalty, you’ll pay a 10% greater premium for each 12-month period that you just had been eligible for Medicare Part B however didn’t join it. You may should pay this larger premium for so long as you’re enrolled in Medicare.<p>

But that much less-private system of health care been taken off the table on this nation by the private corporate interests who revenue from the costly mess of a health care system we have now. Meant to add to my problem shown above — a Social Security employee told me that to keep away from starting Medicare on my 65th birthday, regardless of once I apply, I would have had to make the request six months BEFORE my sixty fifth birthday.<p>
