<p>Drop a Medicare Advantage plan and go back to Original Medicare . Will your medicine still be on the plan’s drug listing next 12 months? Yes, as soon as you enroll in Original Medicare Part A and/or Part B. How much time you need to get extra coverage is determined by when you enroll in Original Medicare.<p>

Keep in thoughts that you might have to pay a late enrollment penalty for Medicare Part A and/or Part B if you didn't join whenever you have been first eligible.

<p>The amount you pay for Part D deductibles, copayments, and/or coinsurance varies by plan.

Most people do not pay a month-to-month premium for Part A (sometimes known as "premium-free Part A"). If you paid Medicare taxes for lower than 30 quarters, the usual Part A premium is $458.
