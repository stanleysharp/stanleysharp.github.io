The plans also provide extra benefits which might be well-liked with the elderly, together with health club memberships and eyeglasses and often are inexpensive than normal Medicare. Once the OOP maximum is reached for a person under a Part C health plan, the plan pays one hundred% of medical services for the rest of the calendar yr. That safety has no lifetime most, another problem with Medicare Part A which has a lifetime limit on inpatient hospitalization coverage. But the Part C OOP restrict does not apply to a Part C plan's Part-D-like self-administered drug coverage .<p>
