<p>If you’re drawing Social Security, you’ll be mechanically enrolled. You can join or postpone your Part B by contacting the Social Security Administration instantly.<p>
<p>Be certain to consider how you will pay for the issues Medicare does not cover. For instance, it typically doesn't cover dental work and routine vision or listening to care.
