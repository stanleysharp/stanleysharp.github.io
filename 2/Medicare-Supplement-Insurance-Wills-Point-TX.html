You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of should you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

<p>Whether you even have coverage via your employer has no bearing on whether or not you’ll pay a premium for Medicare.
