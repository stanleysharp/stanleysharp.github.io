<p>People who aren’t but amassing Social Security, or aren’t eligible for Social Security Retirement, aren’t automatically enrolled into Medicare. Some people get Medicare Part A and Part B routinely and a few folks want to sign up for them.<p>

In most states, the vast majority of enrollees are in HMOs; however, in 12 states , the vast majority of enrollees are in native PPOs .<p>
<p>If you enroll in Medicare in the course of the January – March General Enrollment interval, you possibly can enroll in Part D between April 1 and June 30. But Medicare Part B has a monthly premium — projected to be about $153.30/month in 2021 — which will be deducted out of your Social Security or Railroad Retirement check.
