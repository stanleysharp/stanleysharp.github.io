<p>Within states, Medicare Advantage penetration varies widely across counties. For instance, in Florida, sixty six % of all beneficiaries dwelling in Miami-Dade County are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans whereas solely 10 p.c of beneficiaries living in Monroe County achieve this.<p>
<p>Medicare Advantage plans could cost decrease premiums than you’d pay for Medicare plus a medigap coverage and Part D prescription-drug coverage. But you could find yourself paying higher out-of-pocket costs throughout the year. Private Medicare Advantage plans could be a good deal for seniors on the lookout for all-in-one medical and drug coverage.

<p>Even in case you are glad with your current Medicare coverage, take a look at other Medicare options in your space which will better suit your individual wants within the upcoming 12 months.
