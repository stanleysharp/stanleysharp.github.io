It doesn’t matter if your employer has 20 full-time or part-time workers; the edge is 20 to be considered a gaggle health plan for Medicare special enrollment purposes.<p>
<p>When you obtain the listing of plans, check the plans’ web sites or call them to see which most closely fits your needs. Assign your Medicare benefits to your UC-sponsored retiree medical plan.

<p>For home partners (similar- and reverse-gender), Medicare can pay primary to your UC medical plan. If you might be required to pay a premium for Part A as a retiree, you aren't required to enroll in Medicare Parts A and B. However, UC does require that you simply ship in a denial letter from Social Security to keep your present coverage. Some of UC’s retiree medical plans have Medicare versions and a few have a corresponding companion plan (UC Care, CORE, UC Blue & Gold). If your current retiree plan has a Medicare version or partner plan, you’ll be transferred into that plan if you turn 65, as soon as Medicare has approved your enrollment form.<p>
<p>You can delay your Part B effective date up to three months when you enroll whilst you still have employer-sponsored coverage or inside one month after that coverage ends. Otherwise, your Part B coverage will begin the month after you enroll.

<p>Instead, you’ll use the Medicare common enrollment interval, which runs from January 1 to March 31.

I can’t find anything on their website and before I spend an hour on maintain with SSA I thought I would ask you.
