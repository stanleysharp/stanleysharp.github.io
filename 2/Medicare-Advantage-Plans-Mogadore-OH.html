Or would this break the ten hours/week rule, and what are the implications?

Prior authorization is most often required for comparatively costly companies, similar to inpatient hospital stays, expert nursing facility stays, and Part B drugs, however infrequently required for preventive providers. Beginning in 2019, Medicare Advantage plans also can require enrollees to make use of “step remedy” for Part B drugs, meaning that they're required to try some specific medicine before they receive approval to attempt other medicine.
