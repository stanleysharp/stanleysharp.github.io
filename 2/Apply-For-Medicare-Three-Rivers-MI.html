<p>You received’t should pay more cash on your health care when you hit your yearly limit. Original Medicare has no limitations on how much you pay in your care. If you regularly require high-cost medical care, you might be able to get monetary savings when you limit your bills with an Advantage plan.<p>
<p>Many Medicare Supplement plans don't cover benefits like vision, dental, eyeglasses, hearing aids, or prescription drug coverage. If you want prescribed drugs, you would need to enroll in a standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan. Medicare Advantage, also called Part C, replaces Original Medicare should you enroll in coverage. Advantage plans are provided by private insurance companies and are required to cover every little thing you'll have with Original Medicare.<p>
