<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, will be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this yr if you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after 65, you should half HSA contributions six months before you signal as much as avoid tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because when you enroll properly after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

Seniors are generally advised to sign up on time to avoid penalties that would show quite expensive over the course of retirement.<p>
