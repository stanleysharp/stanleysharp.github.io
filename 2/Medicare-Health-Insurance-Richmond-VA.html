<p>But these averages masks broad regional and beneficial differences. Just as an important good thing about Part C plans is the annual out of pocket spend safety, the main determinant of month-to-month premium differences is the dimensions of that safety. By legislation, a Part C beneficiary can not spend more than $6700 out of pocket yearly on medical services; it's plans with this restrict which have the lowest premiums. Conversely, some Part C plans have OOP limits as low as $1500 annually but after all -- for these plans -- the premium is higher.
