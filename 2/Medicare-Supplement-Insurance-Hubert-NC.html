<p>If your husband has a bunch health plan and works for a corporation of 20 people or more, he does not have to enroll in Medicare at 65. If he takes Part A only, which is free, Medicare might be his secondary.<p>
<p>Certain individuals younger than age 65 can qualify for Medicare, too, together with those with disabilities and those who have everlasting kidney failure. lower than eight months have elapsed since you didn’t have both present job-based mostly group health coverage or Medicare Part B.

Would you wish to be taught extra about your Medicare benefits and coverage options, and the way a partner’s eligibility may affect your eligibility?<p>
<p>If you don’t enroll in Part B, your insurer will “claw again” the quantity it paid for your care when it finds out. At that time, you would wish to enroll in Part B, but would possibly now not qualify for the SEP should you delayed enrolling for greater than 8 months. If you’re satisfied along with your current Medicare plan, you don’t have to take any action.
