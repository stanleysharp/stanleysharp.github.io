<p>Replace a Medicare Advantage plan with a standalone Medicare prescription drug plan. Switch to a special Medicare Advantage or Medicare prescription drug plan. Enroll in a Medicare Advantage or Medicare prescription drug plan.

Some of those "qualifying events" may include retiring and no longer having coverage from an employer or shifting out of your current plan’s service space.<p>
