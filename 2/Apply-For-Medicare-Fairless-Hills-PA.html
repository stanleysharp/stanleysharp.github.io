You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this yr should you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you should half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign up to keep away from tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because when you enroll nicely after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
