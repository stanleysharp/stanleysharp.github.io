Medigap plans, like Medicare Advantage plans, are provided through private insurance companies, and are available for purchase by way of brokers like eHealth Insurance Services, Inc. The Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period runs from January 1 to March 31. Many beneficiaries are routinely eligible for premium-free Medicare Part A coverage; for example, those who have worked or spouses have worked no less than 10 years, or 40 quarters, and paid Medicare taxes via their employment.

<p>With a PFFS, you'll be able to see any Medicare-accredited provider who accepts the payment phrases and is prepared to deal with you.
