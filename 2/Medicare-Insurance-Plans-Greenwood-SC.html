<p>In general, when you’re enrolled in Medicare, you don’t must take motion to renew your coverage yearly. This is true whether you might be in Original Medicare, a Medicare Advantage plan, or a Medicare prescription drug plan. As lengthy as you proceed to pay any necessary premiums, your Medicare coverage should routinely renew every year with a number of exceptions as described below. Your medical health insurance could also be covered by a gaggle medical insurance plan through your employer. You can enroll in Medicare at any time if you lose your group insurance.<p>

They could also be eligible based mostly on a partner or family member’s present employment if the employer has one hundred or extra employees.<p>
