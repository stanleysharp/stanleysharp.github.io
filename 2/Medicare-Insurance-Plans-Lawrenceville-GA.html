If you do not sign up for Part B when you're first eligible, you could have to pay a late enrollment penalty.<p>
<p>However, domestic partners (similar-gender and reverse-gender) are often not eligible to defer enrollment into Part B without incurring late enrollment penalties. These individuals are suggested to contact Social Security three months earlier than turning age 65 to inquire about Part B enrollment options and whether late enrollment penalties apply if enrollment is deferred. The guidelines are different for workers and retirees; so to be sure you enroll correctly, keep away from Medicare premium penalties and understand how Medicare works along with your UC-sponsored medical plan, comply with these steps.
