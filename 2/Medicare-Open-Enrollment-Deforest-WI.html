If you or your spouse paid Medicare taxes at least 10 years whereas working, you typically don’t need to pay a Medicare Part A premium. Because you and your spouse enroll in Medicare separately, you may make different choices in the way you obtain your Medicare benefits. As a result of these choices, you could have variations in your Medicare benefits. There are four “components” to the Medicare insurance program, every one offering a certain set of Medicare benefits.<p>
<p>If you’re drawing Social Security, you’ll be automatically enrolled. You can sign up for or postpone your Part B by contacting the Social Security Administration directly.<p>

The Medicare model of your present plan could have completely different benefits, docs, service areas and behavioral health providers than the non-Medicare model.<p>
<p>But these averages mask wide regional and beneficial variations. Just as an important good thing about Part C plans is the annual out of pocket spend safety, the most important determinant of monthly premium differences is the dimensions of that protection. By legislation, a Part C beneficiary can not spend greater than $6700 out of pocket yearly on medical companies; it is plans with this restrict that have the bottom premiums. Conversely, some Part C plans have OOP limits as low as $1500 annually but of course -- for these plans -- the premium is higher. Note that an OOP restrict isn't a deductible as is usually reported.<p>
