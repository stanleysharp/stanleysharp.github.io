Some of UC’s retiree medical plans have Medicare versions and some have a corresponding associate plan (UC Care, CORE, UC Blue & Gold).

This average includes zero-premium plans and Medicare Advantage plans that don’t include Part D coverage — if we only have a look at plans that do have premiums and that do include Part D coverage, the common premium is about $36/month.<p>
