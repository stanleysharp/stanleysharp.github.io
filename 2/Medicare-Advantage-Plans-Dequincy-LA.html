<h3>Medicare Phone Number Dequincy Louisiana 70633</h3>
<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding payments, shall be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this yr if you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after sixty five, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you sign up to keep away from tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because when you enroll nicely after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
