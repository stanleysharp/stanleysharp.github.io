<p>And Medicare will definitely not require you to maintain it when you sign up. Once your group health coverage ends, you get a particular enrollment interval that lasts eight months.

<p>What you might be seeing is Medicare taxes taken out of your earnings through payroll. If your earnings is high though, the Part B premium is kind of costly.<p>
<p>For example, should you waited for 3 years to sign up, your penalty could be 30% of the premium. In this example, you would possibly pay your Part B month-to-month premium, plus 30%, for so long as you've Part B. If you’re not eligible for premium-free Medicare Part A, you'll need to join it when you first become eligible to do so.<p>
