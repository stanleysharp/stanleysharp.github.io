<p>Can I proceed to make HSA contribution via June 2020, or do I have to cease 6 months earlier than July 1, 2020. My husband is turning 65 here in April, hes not planning on retiring until late fall maybe? He works for a city in a small city and ther are solely two employees, but they're in a bunch medical plan with other cities. If you could have group coverage already and are already signed up for Medicare, you might as nicely take that free coverage so it can function your secondary insurance.
