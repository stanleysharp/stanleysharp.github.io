The Part C threat adjusted funds to Medicare Advantage plans are designed to limit this churn between forms of Medicare (managed vs. FFS), however it is unclear how efficient that equalization program is. In addition Medicare Advantage plans may cover benefits in a different way. For instance, plans that require larger out-of-pocket prices than Medicare Parts A or B for some benefits, similar to skilled nursing facility care, might provide decrease copayments for physician visits to steadiness their benefits package.<p>
<p>But these averages mask wide regional and beneficial variations.
