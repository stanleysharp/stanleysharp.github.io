If you might be required to pay a premium for Part A as a retiree, you are not required to enroll in Medicare Parts A and B. However, UC does require that you just ship in a denial letter from Social Security to maintain your current coverage. Some of UC’s retiree medical plans have Medicare versions and a few have a corresponding partner plan (UC Care, CORE, UC Blue & Gold). If your present retiree plan has a Medicare version or companion plan, you’ll be transferred into that plan whenever you turn 65, once Medicare has approved your enrollment form.<p>
