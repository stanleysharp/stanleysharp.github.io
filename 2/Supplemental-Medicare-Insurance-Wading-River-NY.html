<p>MA plans might cost cost-sharing for a service that's above or beneath the traditional Medicare cost-sharing for that service.

Some recipients will not pay the total $a hundred and forty four.60 standard premium due to a "hold harmless" provision that stops their Part B premiums from rising more than their Social Security cost-of-dwelling adjustment, or COLA.

That mentioned, you should qualify for Special Enrollment into Part B if you do determine to delay enrollment.<p>
