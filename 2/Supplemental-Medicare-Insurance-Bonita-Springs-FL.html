<p>Yes, you can enroll in Medicare at sixty five and cease paying premiums for your present insurance. The six months of retroactive coverage applies when you join Medicare after age 65. At that time, when you enroll, your coverage dates back to both six months, or your 65th birthday — whichever is shorter. It doesn’t matter in case your employer has 20 full-time or half-time workers; the brink is 20 to be thought-about a gaggle health plan for Medicare particular enrollment purposes.<p>

<h3>Keys to Choosing the Right Individual Health Insurance Plan in Bonita Springs</h3>
