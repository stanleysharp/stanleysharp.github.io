<p>As a general rule, individuals who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age sixty five must discuss with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether they should enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for data form generally known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you’ve had coverage through them for the reason that month you turned sixty five, thus qualifying you for special enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not conversant in union legal guidelines mandating that you just sign up for Medicare at a given time.<p>

<p>Recently, I began a part-time job and noticed that the company in withdrawal money for Medicare. When very small employers be a part of together with different employers in conditions like this, the plan will provide main coverage as long as at least one of the employers has 20+ staff. But employers can also ask for exceptions to the primary/secondary rule in that circumstance, so he’ll have to check with his group plan to see what their particular rules are.
