Meant to add to my drawback shown above — a Social Security employee told me that to keep away from starting Medicare on my sixty fifth birthday, regardless of after I apply, I would have had to make the request six months BEFORE my 65th birthday.<p>
<p>A late enrollment penalty may be relevant if you didn't sign up for Medicare Part B whenever you were first eligible.

If you aren’t getting benefits from Social Security a minimum of four months earlier than you turn 65, you may want to enroll with Social Security to get Part A and Part B.
