When very small employers be a part of along with other employers in situations like this, the plan will provide primary coverage as long as at least one of many employers has 20+ staff. But employers also can ask for exceptions to the first/secondary rule in that circumstance, so he’ll need to check together with his group plan to see what their specific guidelines are.
