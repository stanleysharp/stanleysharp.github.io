Medicare enrollees are not allowed to contribute to an HSA, even when they proceed to have coverage underneath an employer’s HSA-certified excessive-deductible health plan. That stated, it typically pays to enroll in Medicare Part A on time even in case you have health coverage already. It gained’t cost you something, and this way, Medicare can serve as your secondary insurance and potentially choose up the tab for something your main insurance doesn’t cover. If you don't sign up for Part B if you're first eligible, you could have to pay a late enrollment penalty.<p>
