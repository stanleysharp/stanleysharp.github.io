Medicare enrollees usually are not allowed to contribute to an HSA, even if they continue to have coverage underneath an employer’s HSA-qualified high-deductible health plan. That said, it often pays to enroll in Medicare Part A on time even in case you have health coverage already.

Some recipients won't pay the full $one hundred forty four.60 normal premium because of a "hold innocent" provision that forestalls their Part B premiums from rising more than their Social Security cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA.
