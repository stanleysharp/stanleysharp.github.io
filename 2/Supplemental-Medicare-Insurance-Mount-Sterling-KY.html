<p>If you don’t take many prescribed drugs, look for a plan with a low month-to-month premium. All plans should still cover most medicine utilized by people with Medicare.

<p>That is why having selection between forms of Medicare and lots of selections inside Part C is so essential.

In most cases, it depends on whether or not you’re getting Social Security benefits.<p>
