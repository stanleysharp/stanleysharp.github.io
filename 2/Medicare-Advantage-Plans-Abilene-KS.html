<p>You may not should pay a late enrollment penalty should you enroll throughout a specialty enrollment interval in Abilene. If you're turning 65 – however you’re not but receiving Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits – you gained’t be mechanically enrolled in Original Medicare. Instead, you’ll have the ability to enroll during a seven-month enrollment interval that includes the three months earlier than your birth month, the month you turn sixty five, and the three following months. So when you’ll be 65 on July 14, your open enrollment period will be April via October.<p>
<p>That is why having selection between types of Medicare and plenty of decisions inside Part C is so essential.

<p>The solely exception is when you’re contributing to a health savings account and want to proceed doing so. Medicare enrollees usually are not allowed to contribute to an HSA, even if they continue to have coverage beneath an employer’s HSA-qualified high-deductible health plan. That mentioned, it typically pays to enroll in Medicare Part A on time even if you have health coverage already. It won’t cost you anything, and this way, Medicare can function your secondary insurance and probably decide up the tab for anything your primary insurance doesn’t cover.

You could then have to pay a late-enrollment penalty for Medicare Part B since you might have had Part B and did not enroll. If you owe a late-enrollment penalty, you’ll pay a ten% higher premium for every 12-month interval that you simply have been eligible for Medicare Part B but didn’t sign up for it. You could have to pay this higher premium for as long as you’re enrolled in Medicare.<p>
