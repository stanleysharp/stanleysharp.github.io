"About a month or two before you flip 65, you may be automatically enrolled, and your card will just present up within the mail," Roberts mentioned.<p>

<p>It may also be important to grasp the implications for beneficiaries in both Medicare Advantage plans and conventional Medicare, by way of costs, benefits, premiums, quality of care, patient outcomes, and access to suppliers. After exceeding this catastrophic threshold, beneficiaries pay 5 percent of the cost of medication. Both stand-alone Medicare prescription drug plans and MA-PDs have the pliability to range the price-sharing design of their Part D benefit; however, CMS limits the plans’ deductibles and in 2017 the deductible cannot exceed $four hundred.
