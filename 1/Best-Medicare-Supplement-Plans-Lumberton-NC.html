The Part C risk adjusted payments to Medicare Advantage plans are designed to limit this churn between types of Medicare (managed vs. FFS), however it's unclear how efficient that equalization program is. In addition Medicare Advantage plans might cover benefits differently. For example, plans that require larger out-of-pocket costs than Medicare Parts A or B for some benefits, similar to skilled nursing facility care, might provide lower copayments for doctor visits to balance their benefits package.<p>
