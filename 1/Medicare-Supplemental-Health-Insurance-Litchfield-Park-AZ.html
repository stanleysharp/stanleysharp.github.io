If your existing retiree plan has a Medicare version or associate plan, you’ll be transferred into that plan when you flip 65, once Medicare has approved your enrollment form.<p>
<p>If it pays secondary to Medicare, whether or not and the way it can pay in the event that they don’t enroll in Part A and/or Part B.

Having Part A will disqualify any HSA contributions he makes for that portion of the year, which might lead to penalties.
