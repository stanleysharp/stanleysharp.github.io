Prior authorization is most often required for relatively expensive companies, corresponding to inpatient hospital stays, skilled nursing facility stays, and Part B medicine, but sometimes required for preventive providers. Beginning in 2019, Medicare Advantage plans can even require enrollees to make use of “step remedy” for Part B medication, that means that they're required to try some particular medicine before they receive approval to try other medication. In distinction to Medicare Advantage plans, conventional Medicare does not usually require prior authorization for companies, and doesn't require step therapy for Part B medication.<p>
