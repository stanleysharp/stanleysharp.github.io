<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, will be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this yr if you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after 65, you should half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal up to avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because if you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
