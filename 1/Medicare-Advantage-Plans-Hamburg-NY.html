You might then should pay a late-enrollment penalty for Medicare Part B since you might have had Part B and didn't enroll. If you owe a late-enrollment penalty, you’ll pay a 10% larger premium for each 12-month interval that you just had been eligible for Medicare Part B however didn’t join it.

A Medicare Advantage plan will wrap your Medicare Part A and Part B coverage into one plan.<p>
<p>And Medicare will definitely not require you to keep it once you join. Once your group health coverage ends, you get a special enrollment period that lasts eight months.
