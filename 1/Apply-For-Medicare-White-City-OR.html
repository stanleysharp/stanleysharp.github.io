<p>These income limits apply in 2020, and are indexed for inflation. There is now not a donut hole in terms of the maximum quantity that enrollees could be charged when they fill prescriptions. But the donut hole still exists by way of how insurers design their coverage , how complete drug prices are counted, and who covers the bulk of the cost of the medication (the drug plan versus the producer; see Figure 4 right here).<p>
<p>Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage also handle payments to healthcare providers differently. Under Original Medicare, the Medicare program reimburses healthcare providers with a fee for every service provided to a beneficiary.
