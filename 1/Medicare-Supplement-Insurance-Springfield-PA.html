<p>Can I continue to make HSA contribution through June 2020, or do I have to stop 6 months earlier than July 1, 2020. My husband is popping 65 here in April, hes not planning on retiring till late fall maybe? He works for a city in a small town and ther are only two employees, but they're in a gaggle medical plan with different towns.

If you owe a late-enrollment penalty, you’ll pay a 10% larger premium for every 12-month interval that you simply had been eligible for Medicare Part B but didn’t sign up for it. You may should pay this larger premium for so long as you’re enrolled in Medicare.<p>
