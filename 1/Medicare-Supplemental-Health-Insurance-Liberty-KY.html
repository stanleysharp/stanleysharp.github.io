<p>As a basic rule, individuals who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age 65 need to discuss with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether or not they need to enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for information form generally known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you’ve had coverage via them for the reason that month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for particular enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not familiar with union laws mandating that you simply sign up for Medicare at a given time.<p>
