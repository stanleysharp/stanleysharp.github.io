<h3>Overusing Your Health Insurance in Erie</h3>
<p>When you enroll with a Medicare Advantage Plan, you pay 2 premiums each month — a premium in your Advantage coverage and a separate premium for Medicare Part B coverage. These plans usually also have greater deductibles, so you should carefully compare these plans with your income earlier than you make a decision. Instead of merely responding to a gross sales pitch from an insurance agent or to an ad, check the entire Medicare options in your area. Compare plans utilizing the Medicare Options Compare tool at Medicare.gov/mppf, taking a look at both premiums and complete estimated prices for individuals like yourself. For example, your Medicare Advantage plan might have a $15 copay if you see the physician.<p>
