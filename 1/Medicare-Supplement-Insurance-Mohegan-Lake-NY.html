Instead of simply responding to a sales pitch from an insurance agent or to an ad, check all the Medicare options in your area. Compare plans using the Medicare Options Compare tool at Medicare.gov/mppf, looking at each premiums and whole estimated prices for people like yourself.

Advantage plans limit what you'll be able to pay out-of-pocket for coverage.<p>
