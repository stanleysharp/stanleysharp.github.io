You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this year when you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after sixty five, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you signal up to keep away from tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of if you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
