<p>Even if you're satisfied together with your present Medicare coverage, have a look at other Medicare options in your area which will higher suit your particular person wants within the upcoming year. For instance, check to see if there may be one other plan in your area that can give you better health and/or drug coverage at a extra inexpensive price.

There could possibly be another Part D plan in your space that covers the drugs you're taking with fewer restrictions and/or lower prices.<p>
<p>You should be able to do nothing and not enroll in Part B till you’re able to. Medicare enrollment at sixty five isn't computerized – they don’t sign you up just because you attain sixty five.
