The Medicare Advantage Disenrollment Period offers an MA plan enrollee the opportunity to disenroll from any MA plan and return to traditional Medicare between January 1 and February 14 of every year.<p>
<p>However, home companions (same-gender and reverse-gender) are often not eligible to defer enrollment into Part B without incurring late enrollment penalties. These individuals are advised to contact Social Security three months before turning age 65 to inquire about Part B enrollment options and whether late enrollment penalties apply if enrollment is deferred. The guidelines are completely different for employees and retirees; so to be sure you enroll correctly, avoid Medicare premium penalties and perceive how Medicare works with your UC-sponsored medical plan, observe these steps. If you don't make any changes throughout AEP, your present plan will routinely renew the following yr.

<p>You can even enroll in a Part D plan should you solely enroll in Medicare Part B during the GEP. If you enroll in both Part A and Part B, you may select to use for a Medicare Advantage , Medicare Prescription Drug , or Medicare Supplement plan. You can even apply for a Part D plan if you solely enroll in Medicare Part B during your IEP.<p>
