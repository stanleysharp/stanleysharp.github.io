<p>Third, individuals who reside in two different geographical areas of the nation at different occasions of the year (largely so-known as snowbirds) discover it difficult to reside with the geographic restrictions of most public Part C plans. The Part C threat adjusted payments to Medicare Advantage plans are designed to restrict this churn between forms of Medicare (managed vs. FFS), but it's unclear how efficient that equalization program is.

In this instance, you might pay your Part B monthly premium, plus 30%, for as long as you could have Part B. If you’re not eligible for premium-free Medicare Part A, you will want to join it when you first turn out to be eligible to take action.<p>
