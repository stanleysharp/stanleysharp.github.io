<p>Nearly sixteen million seniors have joined about 700 insurance policy that accept a set charge from Medicare for masking each patient in exchange for providing all medical care, from physician visits to hospital providers. The plans also provide extra benefits which might be popular with the elderly, including fitness center memberships and eyeglasses and sometimes are cheaper than commonplace Medicare. Once the OOP most is reached for a person underneath a Part C health plan, the plan pays a hundred% of medical services for the remainder of the calendar year.
