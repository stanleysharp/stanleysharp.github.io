As a results of these decisions, you could have variations in your Medicare benefits. There are four “components” to the Medicare insurance program, each one providing a sure set of Medicare benefits.<p>
<p> The Medicare Advantage program provides folks an alternate means of receiving their Medicare benefits. The program consists of many various health plans that are regulated by Medicare however run by private insurance corporations.
