<p>A rebate cannot contribute to "profit" ("revenue" is in quotes as a result of most Medicare Advantage and other Part C health plans are sponsored by non-profit organizations, primarily built-in health delivery techniques). In 2017, the typical out-of-pocket limit for MA-PD enrollees is $5,219, about the identical as in 2016 ($5,223) and up from $four,313 in 2011 . HMO enrollees have typically had lower out-of-pocket limits than enrollees in local PPOs or regional PPOs, and this stays the case in 2017.
