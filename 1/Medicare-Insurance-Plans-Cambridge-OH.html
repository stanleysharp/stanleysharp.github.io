<p>This means that you must enroll in Medicare if you end up eligible and then TRICARE will fill in the gaps for some providers that Medicare would not cover. You get your coverage through the Affordable Care Act's medical health insurance market. Under the ACA, once you turn 65 you have to transition from an ACA plan to Medicare.<p>
<p>If you might be turning 65 and have employer-based coverage by way of your individual job, you possibly can delay signing up.
