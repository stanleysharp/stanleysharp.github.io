<p>But these averages masks broad regional and beneficial variations. Just as an important good thing about Part C plans is the annual out of pocket spend protection, the most important determinant of month-to-month premium variations is the dimensions of that safety. By law, a Part C beneficiary can't spend more than $6700 out of pocket annually on medical companies; it is plans with this limit that have the lowest premiums.
