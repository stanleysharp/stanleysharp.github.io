<p>If you're turning 65 and have employer-based mostly coverage via your personal job, you can delay signing up. Is the insurance through your work, or do you purchase it separately/individually? If yes, then you should contemplate signing up for Medicare or you would face Part B enrollment penalties, denied claims, or extra. I will turn 65 on July 6, 2020 so I will start Medicare on July 1, 2020.
