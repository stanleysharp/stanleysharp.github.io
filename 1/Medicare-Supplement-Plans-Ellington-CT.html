If you aren’t getting benefits from Social Security at least four months before you turn 65, you will want to sign up with Social Security to get Part A and Part B. I’ll be getting benefits from Social Security or the Railroad Retirement Board a minimum of four months before I flip 65. In most cases, it is dependent upon whether or not you’re getting Social Security benefits.<p>
