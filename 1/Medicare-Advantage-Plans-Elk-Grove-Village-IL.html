<p>As a general rule, people who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) previous age 65 must check with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether they should enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for data form generally known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you’ve had coverage via them since the month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for special enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not acquainted with union legal guidelines mandating that you simply join Medicare at a given time.<p>
<p>If you're turning sixty five and have employer-based mostly coverage via your personal job, you possibly can delay signing up. Is the insurance via your work, or do you buy it separately/individually? If yes, then you should contemplate signing up for Medicare or you would face Part B enrollment penalties, denied claims, or more.

If you enroll in the course of the basic enrollment period, your coverage will start July 1 of that 12 months. You may have to pay a late enrollment penalty should you didn’t join Medicare if you have been first eligible.<p>
