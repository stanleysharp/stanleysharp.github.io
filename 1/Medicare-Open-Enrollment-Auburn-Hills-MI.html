<p>As a common rule, people who plan to proceed to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) previous age sixty five must discuss with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether they should enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for info form often known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you just’ve had coverage via them for the reason that month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for special enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not acquainted with union legal guidelines mandating that you just sign up for Medicare at a given time.<p>

MA plans differ with respect to what benefits they provide, out-of-pocket costs similar to premiums, deductibles, and co-pays, and whether or not they provide prescription drug coverage.

<p>I would suggest addressing that issue with a union consultant and going from there. Some people select to pay for health coverage via an employer plus Medicare. If you’re not being given a alternative then that’s one thing to first tackle with the entity that’s forcing you to obtain Medicare.<p>
<p>Even if you're satisfied with your present Medicare coverage, have a look at other Medicare options in your area that may better suit your individual needs in the upcoming yr.
