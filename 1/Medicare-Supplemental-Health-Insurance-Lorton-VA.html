<p>Medicare Part B at all times comes with a monthly premium, so you might similarly select to delay your Part B enrollment when you or your partner are still working and have employer-primarily based group coverage.

<p>Check with Social Security to see if you are required to pay a Part D premium. These Medicare premiums are in addition to any premium you pay to UC in your UC insurance. If you might be 65 and eligible for Medicare, you have eight months to enroll in Original Medicare without a late penalty after the month your employment or employer coverage ends, whichever comes first.
