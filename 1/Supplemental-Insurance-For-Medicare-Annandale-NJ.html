If you're required to pay a premium for Part A as a retiree, you aren't required to enroll in Medicare Parts A and B. However, UC does require that you simply send in a denial letter from Social Security to keep your current coverage. Some of UC’s retiree medical plans have Medicare variations and a few have a corresponding associate plan (UC Care, CORE, UC Blue & Gold). If your existing retiree plan has a Medicare version or partner plan, you’ll be transferred into that plan when you turn sixty five, as soon as Medicare has accredited your enrollment form.<p>

(You need to pay the Part B premium along with your Advantage premium, even when you’re in a “zero premium” Advantage plan).
