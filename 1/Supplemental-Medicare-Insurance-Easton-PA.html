<p>If it pays secondary to Medicare, whether and how it can pay if they don’t enroll in Part A and/or Part B. Determining whether an individual qualifies for a Special Enrollment Period is the first essential issue to consider when making a call about Part B enrollment.

<p>Medicare Part A provides FFS funds for admitted in-affected person hospital care, hospice, and expert nursing services if an individual is first admitted inpatient for 3 days.
