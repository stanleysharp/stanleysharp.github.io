<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the excellent bills, will be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this 12 months when you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you must half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal up to avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare.
