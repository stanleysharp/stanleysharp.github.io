<p>Medicare Advantage, also known as Medicare Part C, is health coverage supplied by private insurance corporations. Medicare Advantage plans provide the identical benefits as Original Medicare and often consists of additional coverage corresponding to pharmaceuticals, dental, vision, and hearing. MA plans differ with respect to what benefits they supply, out-of-pocket costs corresponding to premiums, deductibles, and co-pays, and whether or not they provide prescription drug coverage. It is necessary to do not forget that if you're happy with your Medicare benefits, whether you might be in conventional Medicare or an MA plan, you don't HAVE to change when the chance arises.

Across all Medicare Advantage plans, the average premium in 2020 is about $23/month, and is predicted to lower to $21/month in 2021.
